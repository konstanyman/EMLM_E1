    "# 1. Nested cross-validation exercise\n",
    "## Nested cross-validation for feature selection with nearest neighbors <br>\n",
    "- Use Python 3 to program both a hyper-parameter selection method based on 5-fold cross-validation and a nested 5-fold cross-validation for estimating the prediction performance of models inferred with this automatic selection approach. Use base learning algorithm provided in the exercise, namely the \"use_ith_feature\" method, so that the value of the hyper-parameter i is automatically selected from the range from 1 to 100 of alternative values. The provided base learning algorithm \"use_ith_feature\" is 1-nearest neighbor that uses only the ith feature of the data given to it. The 5-fold CV based hyper-parameter selection procedure is supposed to select the best feature, e.g. the value of i, based on C-index evaluated with predictions obtained with 5-fold cross-validation. A ready-made implementation of C-index is also provided in the exercise. In nested 5-fold cross-validation, a C_index value is further evaluated on the predictions obtained from an outer 5-fold cross-validation. During each round of this outer 5-fold CV, the whole feature selection process based on inner 5-fold CV is separately done and the selected feature is used for prediction for the test data points held out during that round of the outer CV. Accordingly, the actual learning algorithm, whose prediction performance will be evaluated with nested CV, is the one that automatically selects the single best feature with 5-fold cross-validation based model selection (see the lectures and the pseudo codes presented on them for more info on this interpretation).\n",
    "- Compare the C-index produced by nested 5-fold CV with the result of ordinary 5-fold CV with the best value of i e.g. the feature providing the highest 5-fold CV C-index, and show the C-index difference between the two methods.\n",
    "- Use the provided implementation of the \"use_ith_feature\" learning algorithm and C-index functions in your exercise.\n",
    "\n",
    "As a summary, for completing this exercise implement the following steps: \n",
    "_______________________________________________________________\n",
    "#### 1. Use 5-fold cross-validation for determining the optimal i-parameter for the data (X_train.csv, y_prediction.csv) from the set of possible values of i e.g. {1,...,100}. When you have found the optimal i, save the corresponding C-index (call it 5_fold_c_index) for this parameter.\n",
    "#### 2. Similarly, use nested cross-validation ( 5-fold CV both in outer and inner folds) for estimating the C-index (call it n_5_fold_c_index) of the method that selects the best feature with 5-fold approach. \n",
    "#### 3. Return both this notebook and as a PDF-file made from it in the exercise submit page. \n",
    "_______________________________________________________________\n",

    "Remember to use the provided learning algorithm use_ith_feature and C-index functions in your implementation! "
